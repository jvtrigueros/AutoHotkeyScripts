1. In the G35 Headset Settings Software, set these as your keys in the dropdown lists:

 

G1 : windvd 9.0 : play/pause

G2: windvd 9.0 : rewind

G3: Windvd 9.0 : fast forward

 

2. Download the program Autohotkey @ www.autohotkey.com

 

3. Put this into a txt file, then save it as a .AHK file instead of .TXT

 

#InstallKeybdHook
SC121::msgbox this is one key
SC139::msgbox this is another
SC113::msgbox and this is another

4. Run i and now you see that you have customized each key to do a different action that you have defined in the AHK file.

 

5. Learn the very very simple basics of AHK so you can customize the keys to do whatever you want by going to www.autohotkey.com and asking on the forum, or joining their IRC channel @ irc.freenode.com #ahk
